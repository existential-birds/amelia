# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/existential-birds/amelia/security/advisories/new) tab.

I will respond with next steps and keep you informed of progress towards a fix.

Report security bugs in third-party dependencies to their respective maintainers.

## Supported Versions

Security patches are applied to the latest version only. I recommend always running the latest release.
