# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Amelia. This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the project.

## Why a CLA?

Amelia uses a dual-licensing model (MPL-2.0 for open source, plus a Commercial License for restricted uses). To maintain this model and ensure the project can evolve, we need contributors to grant rights that allow:

- Distribution under the open-source license (MPL-2.0)
- Offering commercial licenses to organizations that need them
- Relicensing if necessary for project sustainability

This CLA is modeled after widely-used contributor agreements and is designed to be fair to contributors while enabling the project's long-term success.

## Agreement

By submitting a contribution (code, documentation, or other materials) to Amelia, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Your"**) means the individual or legal entity making the contribution.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including modifications or additions, that you submit to the project.

**"Project"** means the Amelia software project and its associated repositories.

**"Maintainers"** means the individuals or entities that maintain and manage the Project.

### 2. Grant of Rights

You hereby grant to the Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Project:

a) **Copyright License**: A perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works.

b) **Patent License**: A perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the Project.

c) **Relicensing Rights**: The right to relicense your Contributions under other open-source or commercial licenses as the Maintainers determine appropriate for the Project's sustainability.

### 3. Representations

You represent that:

a) **Authority**: You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and grant the rights described.

b) **Original Work**: Each Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to grant the licenses in this Agreement.

c) **No Encumbrance**: Your Contributions are not subject to any third-party agreements that would restrict the Maintainers' ability to use them as described in this Agreement.

d) **Employer Rights**: If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or your employer has waived such rights.

### 4. Contribution Process

You agree to:

a) Clearly identify any Contributions that are not your original work and provide relevant licensing information.

b) Promptly notify the Maintainers if you become aware of any facts that would make your representations inaccurate.

### 5. No Obligation

You understand that:

a) Your Contributions are provided voluntarily. The Maintainers have no obligation to accept, use, or include your Contributions.

b) This Agreement does not create an employment or agency relationship.

c) The Maintainers may modify, reject, or remove Contributions at their discretion.

### 6. No Warranty

EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS IN SECTION 3, YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
