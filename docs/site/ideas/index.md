# Ideas & Explorations

> **Note:** Documents in this section are exploratory designs created through brainstorming sessions. They represent ideas under consideration but **are not commitments**. Some may never be implemented, others may change significantly before implementation.

These documents are created using the [superpowers:brainstorming](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skill in Claude Code, which provides structured exploration through Socratic questioning.

## Lifecycle

```
Brainstorming Session → Idea Document (here) → Roadmap Item → Implementation Plan → Code
