# Ideas & Explorations

> **Note:** Ideas in this section are exploratory designs created through brainstorming sessions. They represent ideas under consideration but **are not commitments**. Some may never be implemented, others may change significantly before implementation.

## Tracking

Ideas are now tracked as GitHub issues with the `idea` label. This allows for better discussion, prioritization, and linking to implementation PRs.

**Current idea issues:**
- [#202 - Debate Mode](https://github.com/existential-birds/amelia/issues/202) - Multi-agent deliberation for design decisions
- [#203 - Knowledge Library](https://github.com/existential-birds/amelia/issues/203) - Co-learning system for developers and agents
- [#204 - Spec Builder](https://github.com/existential-birds/amelia/issues/204) - Document-assisted technical design tool

## Lifecycle

```
Brainstorming Session → GitHub Issue (idea label) → Roadmap Item → Implementation Plan → Code
```

Ideas that mature may be added to the [Roadmap](/reference/roadmap) as planned features.
