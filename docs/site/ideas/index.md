# Ideas & Explorations

> **Note:** Documents in this section are exploratory designs created through brainstorming sessions. They represent ideas under consideration but **are not commitments**. Some may never be implemented, others may change significantly before implementation.

These documents are created using the [superpowers:brainstorming](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skill in Claude Code, which provides structured exploration through Socratic questioning.

## Current Explorations

| Idea | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [Knowledge Library](./knowledge-library) | Co-learning system for developers and agents | Draft |
| [Debate Mode](./debate-mode) | Multi-agent deliberation for design decisions | Draft |
| [Spec Builder](./spec-builder) | Document-assisted technical design tool | Draft |

## Lifecycle

```
Brainstorming Session → Idea Document (here) → Roadmap Item → Implementation Plan → Code
```

Ideas that mature may be added to the [Roadmap](/reference/roadmap) as planned features.
