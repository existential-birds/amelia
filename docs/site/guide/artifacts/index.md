# Example Artifacts

Amelia produces structured artifacts throughout the development lifecycle. These examples showcase the format and depth of each artifact type.

## Artifact Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Design** | Technical specs defining how to build a feature | [View →](./design-example) |
| **Plan** | Batched execution steps with risk assessment | [View →](./plan-example) |
| **Review** | Feedback on correctness, security, maintainability | [View →](./review-example) |

## How Artifacts Are Used

```
Issue → Architect (design) → Plan Approval → Developer (plan) → Reviewer (review) → Done
```

1. **Design**: The Architect agent analyzes requirements and produces a design document
2. **Plan**: The design is translated into an executable plan with batched steps
3. **Review**: The Reviewer evaluates changes against the design and coding standards

## Current Status

These artifacts are currently produced manually using hey-amelia. Automated artifact generation is on the [roadmap](/reference/roadmap).
