::: warning Coming Soon
Code review examples are coming soon. Reviews will demonstrate:

- **Design adherence** verification against the approved spec
- **Correctness analysis** including edge cases and error handling
- **Security assessment** for common vulnerabilities
- **Performance review** identifying potential bottlenecks
- **Maintainability feedback** on code structure and patterns
- **Test coverage** evaluation
