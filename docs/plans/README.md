# Implementation Plans

This folder contains active implementation plans for in-progress work. Plans are temporary documents that guide development and should be deleted once their corresponding features are merged.

## Active Plans

*No active plans at this time.*

## Plan Lifecycle

```
Design (brainstorming/) → Plan (here) → Implementation → Merge → Delete Plan
```

Plans in this folder are:
- **Actionable** - Ready for implementation with specific tasks
- **Temporary** - Deleted after the feature is merged
- **Task-oriented** - Broken into discrete, executable steps
