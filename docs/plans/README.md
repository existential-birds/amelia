## Plan Lifecycle

```
Design (brainstorming/) → Plan (here) → Implementation → Merge → Delete Plan
```

Plans in this folder are:
- **Actionable** - Ready for implementation with specific tasks
- **Temporary** - Deleted after the feature is merged
- **Task-oriented** - Broken into discrete, executable steps
