# Contributor License Agreement

## Purpose

Amelia uses a dual-licensing model: the open-source code is available under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0), while a separate commercial license is available for restricted uses such as resale, hosting as a service, or embedding in paid products.

To maintain this model, we need contributors to grant rights that allow us to:
- Distribute contributions under MPL-2.0 (open source)
- Include contributions in commercially-licensed versions of Amelia

This CLA makes those rights explicit.

## Agreement

By submitting a contribution (pull request, patch, code, documentation, or other materials) to Amelia, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

**"You"** means the individual or legal entity submitting the contribution.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship you submit to the project, including modifications or additions to existing work.

**"Project"** means Amelia and its associated repositories.

**"Maintainer"** means the project owner and their successors or assigns.

### 2. Copyright Ownership

You retain copyright ownership of your contributions. This agreement does not transfer ownership of your intellectual property.

### 3. License Grant

You grant to the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to:

- Use, copy, modify, and distribute your contributions
- Create derivative works based on your contributions
- Sublicense the above rights to third parties
- Relicense your contributions under different terms, including commercial license terms

This grant allows the Maintainer to include your contributions in both the open-source distribution (under MPL-2.0) and in commercially-licensed versions of Amelia.

### 4. Patent License

You grant to the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, use, sell, and distribute your contributions. This license applies only to patent claims you can license that are necessarily infringed by your contribution alone.

### 5. Your Representations

You represent that:

a) You have the legal right to grant these licenses. If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have received permission to submit contributions on behalf of that employer, or your employer has waived such rights.

b) Your contribution is your original work, or you have the right to submit it under the terms of this agreement. If any part of your contribution is not your original work, you will clearly identify it and provide licensing information.

c) Your contribution does not violate any agreement you have with a third party, and to your knowledge, no third party has claims to your contribution that would conflict with this agreement.

### 6. No Obligation

The Maintainer has no obligation to accept, use, or include your contributions. This agreement does not create an employment or agency relationship.

### 7. "As Is"

Your contributions are provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
