Follow a systematic debugging workflow for this problem:

$ARGUMENTS

## Systematic Debugging Process

1. **Reproduce the issue** - Confirm you can observe the problem
2. **Gather information** - Read error messages, logs, and relevant code
3. **Form hypotheses** - List 2-3 possible causes ranked by likelihood
4. **Test hypotheses** - Add logging/debugging to verify or eliminate each
5. **Identify root cause** - Trace the actual cause, not just symptoms
6. **Implement fix** - Make the minimal change to fix the issue
7. **Verify fix** - Confirm the problem is resolved and no regressions
