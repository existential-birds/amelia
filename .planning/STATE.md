# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** When a reviewer leaves comments on a PR, Amelia detects them, fixes the code, pushes the update, and resolves the comments -- without manual intervention.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Data Models & Configuration

## Current Position

Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 10 phases derived from 56 requirements following dependency graph (models -> API -> classification -> pipeline -> resolution -> orchestration -> triggers -> polling -> dashboard -> metrics)
- Roadmap: Phases 7 (CLI/API) and 8 (Polling) can execute in parallel since both depend only on Phase 6
- [Phase 01]: Added field_validator on AggressivenessLevel for bidirectional string/int parsing to support JSON round-trip with string serialization
- [Phase 01]: Included pr_number as optional field on PRReviewComment for self-contained context
- [Phase 01]: Followed sandbox JSONB pattern for pr_autofix: NULL default since None means feature disabled
- [Phase 01]: pr_polling_enabled defaults to FALSE at database level with NOT NULL constraint
- [Phase 01]: Applied model_fields_set fix to both pr_autofix and sandbox fields for consistent nullable JSONB handling

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 4 (Core Fix Pipeline) needs experimentation on Developer agent prompting for PR-fix-specific context
- Research flag: Phase 8 (Polling Service) needs real-world validation of rate limit budget calculations
